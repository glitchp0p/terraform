***Terreact***

***TODO LIST***

--mine--

let's revisit the core concepts and features.

low poly graphics for fun cool cute aesthetics
manipulation of time to slow down ans speed up "reactions"
reactions is a good concept for how the elements interact.
terreact could be a great title
reactions could happen at different time scales from milliseconds to geological
so the game is really an emergent simulation, or interactive simulation as game loop

I've also had an insight about game mechanics. it would be very interesting to build it as a mini programming language. we will would need to design it to be simple and intuitive, modular. so building blocks (functions etc) are discovered through play. this language will hopefully be primarily visual, and audible, rather than text based. 

there's a lot here so we'll need to approach the project step by step

--claude's summary--
This is a fantastic evolution of your vision! "Terreact" is a perfect title - it captures both terraforming and reactions beautifully.
Core Vision Summary:

Interactive simulation with time manipulation (milliseconds to geological time)
Visual programming language discovered through play
Multi-scale reactions creating emergent complexity
Low-poly aesthetics for charm and performance

The programming language insight is brilliant! Players discovering computational building blocks through experimentation rather than learning syntax - very much aligned with your anti-grinding philosophy.
Stepping back to see the architecture:
Your current foundation (element combinations) becomes the basic reaction system
Next layer could be time manipulation - watch reactions unfold at different speeds
Then spatial relationships - reactions happening in 3D space
Finally visual programming - players building reaction chains
Immediate next steps to consider:

Time system - add a simple tick/speed control to your current reactions
Spatial grid - place elements in 3D space, reactions affect neighbors
Reaction visualization - see combinations happening over time
Simple "blocks" - basic visual programming elements

Which feels most exciting to tackle first? The time manipulation could be really satisfying with your current system - watching "dense gooeyness" form slowly or rapidly based on time scale.
What resonates most with your vision right now?
